**Overview**

I made this page for the purpose of (1) compiling all mini projects I'm doing while learning ReactJS, while (2) setting it up to be my interactive web dev portfolio.

I take inspiration from this project by DustinBrett (https://github.com/DustinBrett/daedalOS). Of course as a novice developer that I am, this is just a simple implementation of how a desktop environment works. In the future, more apps and features will be added as I go.

I want it to look like a desktop environment that is loosely based on my current setup. I use Ubuntu btw.

**Taskbar**

For the taskbar, I prefer the Windows setup as it is simple and doesn't occupy much screen height. Uses basic conditional rendering.

**Time and Date**

Uses basic useState hooks. Comes with react-calendar which does nothing but to imitate a time and date popup.

**Welcome Screen**

Uses react-rnd npm package.

**Calculator**

Followed this excellent tutorial by Web Dev Simplified (https://youtu.be/DgRrrOt0Vr8?si=oYyhMYfNP6C6XiZj). Built without any Math libraries, just useReducer Hook.

**Future Apps and Features in mind right now:**

- Weather app
- PDF reader
- Spotiphy
- Conky Linux theme
- Desktop shortcuts
- Terminal
- Mathel Memory (JS game I made while in the bootcamp)
