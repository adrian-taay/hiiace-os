**OVERVIEW**
Welcome! I made this page for the purpose of (1) compiling all the small projects I'm doing while learning ReactJS, while (2) setting it up to be my interactive web dev portfolio.

I take inspiration from this project made by DustinBrett (https://github.com/DustinBrett/daedalOS). As a novice developer, I made this simple implementation of how a desktop environment works. In the future, more apps and features will be added as I go.

**DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT / WINDOWS MANAGER**
I want it to look like a desktop environment that is loosely based on how my current setup looks.

- Ubuntu
- GNOME
- Adwaita Theme
- Dash-to-Panel
- ArcMenu
- Conky Linux

\*\*Tools =>

- react-rnd: To make windows resizable and draggable
- react-icons: Icons and logos
- framer-motion: To animate pop-ups, toggle minimize and maximize, opening and closing of windows.

**TASKBAR**
For the taskbar, I prefer the Windows setup as it is simple and it doesn't occupy much screen height. Uses basic conditional rendering.

- Start Menu
- Active Windows
- Taskbar settings
- Weather app
- Time and Date
- Show Desktop Icon

**TIME AND DATE**
Uses basic useState hooks. Comes with react-calendar which does nothing but to imitate a time and date popup.

\*\*Tools =>

- react-calendar: A basic calendar

**WELCOME SCREEN**
Contains introductory notes and quick links for when the client/interviewer just want to see my resume/social media.

**CALCULATOR**
Followed this excellent tutorial by **Web Dev Simplified** (https://youtu.be/DgRrrOt0Vr8?si=oYyhMYfNP6C6XiZj). Built without any Math libraries, just useReducer Hook.

**CONKY LINUX**
Or Rainmeter if you will. Uses basic styling.

- Time and Date display: **_Uses local machine time and date_**
- Random advice display: **_Fetch API (https://api.adviceslip.com/advice)_**
- Weather display: **_Fetch API (https://openweathermap.org/api)_**
- GitHub stats: **_Trying to find a way to get my stats_**
  https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats
- Codewars stats: **_This as well_**

**Future Apps and Features in mind right now:**

**WEATHER APP**
Fetches data from https://openweathermap.org/api

**TO-DO APP**

**PDF READER**

**TERMINAL**

**MATHEL MEMORY**
JS game I made during bootcamp
